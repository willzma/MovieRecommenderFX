Originally a movie rating C# desktop application developed for a software design class, MovieRecommenderFX began as a JavaFX learning project but eventually expanded greatly over the original, providing significantly better movie information, a better user interface, better security, and even a minor social media aspect, allowing users to not only rate movies but interact with each other.

##Learning
A good learning project, an application like this is not only good for learning JavaFX, but also for learning Java multithreading, Java networking, simple hashing in Java, as well as the use of REST APIs.
