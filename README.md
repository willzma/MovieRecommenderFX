### A reimagining of a simple class project with improved UI and vastly expanded features
Originally a movie rating C# desktop application developed for a software design class, MovieRecommenderFX began as a JavaFX learning project but eventually expanded greatly over the original, providing:
* Substantilly more movie information
* A better user interface 
* Better password security
* A social media aspect, allowing users to interact

##A Learning Project
Developing an application like this is excellent experience towards learning:
* JavaFX 8, an excellent way for developing cross-platform desktop applications
* Java concurrency, since a desktop application like this requires multiple threads working in tandem
* Java networking, since a movie app requires constant updating with online resources
* Java REST APIs, since this represents the best way of getting information from the web
